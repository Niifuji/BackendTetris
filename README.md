# BackendTetris
This is a "simple" tetris game i have made with basic tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVYKG_ch4yM&list=LL&index=83&t=1664s

I have added some features like:
- Score for 1, 2, 3, 4 lines clear and T-spin clear.
- Rotate 180 degree, hold piece, rotate counter clockwise.
- Hard drop, soft drop.
- Hold piece preview.
- Combo counter.
## Instructions
- Use arrow keys to move the piece.
- Use Z and Arrow Up to rotate the piece counter clockwise and clockwise.
- Use A to rotate the piece 180 degree.
- Use Shift to hold the piece.
- Use Space to hard drop the piece.
- Use Arrow Down to soft drop the piece.
- Use P to pause the game.
- Use R to restart the game.
- Use Esc to exit the game.
### How to run the game and where the source code is
- The source code is in the `BackendTetris` folder.
- Resource Files is a folder that contains background images.
- The game is in the `x64\Release` folder.
- Run the `BackendTetris.exe` to play the game.
#### Important
- The game is not perfect, there are some bugs and glitches.

    (If the game is not working, try to download lastest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable.)
